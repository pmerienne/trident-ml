Pos-coffee,2 COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS     By Douglas Learmond  Reuters     LONDON  March 3 - Coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas  ICO delegates and traders said     The failure last night of International Coffee Organization  ICO  producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4-12 year low at one stage of 1 270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1 314 stg  down 184 stg from the previous close     The New York May price was down 1559 at 10800 cents a lb     Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices  some senior traders said     The ICO 15 day average price stood at 11466 cents a lb for March 2 This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop     In a Reuter interview  Brazilian Coffee Institute  IBC  President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions If we have failed at the ICO  at least we have tried  Dauster said  adding now it is time to go and sell coffee     But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month  Dauster said It is too difficult to forecast now Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 112 mln Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on Londons futures market last year     A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market in one go but is sold over a minimum of six months     The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas Consumers said objective criteria like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares  Dauster said     All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the ad hoc way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO     Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings     It is a simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate policy to other producers While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different objective criteria achieve different share-outs of quota  Dauster said     Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise     Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them     We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage  one delegate said     Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed     The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September     More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine In that case quotas could come into force during the summer But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely  while Brazils Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980     A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability     In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found     Producers

Pos-money-fx,2 AFTER G-6  ROUND ONE GOES TO CENTRAL BANKS     By Claire Miller  Reuters     NEW YORK  March 13 - Central banks have easily beaten back the foreign exchange markets first test of the industrialized nations recent pact to stabilize currencies  analysts said     In active trading this week  the market pushed the dollar  sterling  the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher But operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central banks signalled their displeasure     So far G-6 has been a roaring success said James ONeill  financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA     The central banks are sending strong signals that they wont tolerate any kind of momentum building behind currencies  added a senior corporate trader at one UK bank     On February 22  the finance ministers and central bank governors of the US  Japan  West Germany  France and the UK -- the Group of Five -- plus Canada  signed an accord under which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around prevailing levels     The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable two-year decline against major world currencies     And initially  traders indicated their respect for the accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower     But by Wednesday  the dollar climbed to more than 187 marks  about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before the G-6 accord     The move was aided by indications that the US economy picked up steam in February at the same time as the West German economy was regressing     But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave traders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed the idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines     Dealers differed as to whether the US central bank actually intervened to sell dollars above 187 marks  or simply telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading conditions     But the dollar quickly backed off It hovered today around 185 marks The market was surprised that the Fed showed its face so soon  said Marine Midland NAs ONeill     Also on Wednesday  London dealers said the Bank of England intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the UK currency rose to 160 dlrs compared with 15355 dlrs before the G-6 pact     Sterling  along with the other high-yield currencies like the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar  was in favor after traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant to the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays on dollarmark and dollaryen     The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving UK economy  anticipation of a popular British budget on March 17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for the incumbent Conservative party in any general election     There was a real run on sterling  said Anne Mills of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc     Sterling traded today around 15750 dlrs  down from 15870 dlrs last night It slid to 2917 marks from 2950 yesterday and from a peak of about 298 recently Theres been some heavy profit-taking on sterlingmark ahead of next Tuesdays UK budget  said James McGroarty of Discount Corp     As speculators detected the presence of the US and British central banks  they acclerated their shift into Canadian and Australian dollars But here too they were stymied The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currencys rise     The Canadian dollar traded at 1321823 per US dollar today  down from 1318590 yesterday     And the Australian Reserve Bank  using the Fed as agent  sold Australian dollars in the US yesterday  dealers said     The Australian dollar fell to a low of 674555 US cents today from a high of 6902 Thursday     Analysts said the central banks moves to stifle sudden upward movement  leave the market uncertain about its next step Today  the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a very tight range against the dollar for several months     The dollar fell to 1523540 yen from 1533540 last night Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long sterlingshort mark positions established lately     Because of the change in perceptions about the health of the German economy  the funds from those unwinding operations are ending up in yen  a dealer at one UK bank said     Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders  lower industrial output and slowing employment gains     Moreover  the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities who have invested heavily overseas  for example in Australian financial instruments  repatriate their profits ahead of the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31     Noting that the dollaryen rate is in a sense the most controversial one because of the large US trade deficit with Japan  analysts said the stage could be set for another test of the dollars downward scope against the Japanese currency     In its latest review of the foreign exchange market through the end of January  the Federal Reserve revealed that it intervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28 On that day  the dollar fell as low as 15040 yen     Sure  the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level in January But the market has to bear in mind that time marches on and the situation changes  said McGroarty of Discount  Reuter 3

Pos-money-fx,2 FED CHAIRMAN VOLCKER SAYS BANK PROPOSALS A WORRY     WASHINGTON  March 24 - The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board  Paul Volcker  has written to the chairman of the House Banking Committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals scheduled for consideration Wednesday     Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St Germain a proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries that do not grant US firms equal access to their government debt markets might invite retaliation against US firms abroad     He added  even Japan  against whom this proposal seems to be particularly directed  has started opening its markets     In his letter  made available at the Treasury  Volcker also said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to commercial banks  was a problem     I believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the policies that are followed on servicing external debt  Volcker said     It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to extend more credit to the borrowing countries  he said     Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury Secretary James Baker about the inappropriateness of using public resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt  which we both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international debt facility     He also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures for international negotiations on currency exchange rates is unrealistic and could well have damaging effects     For example  the bills directive to intitiate negotiations in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar -- a matter upon which there can be considerable difference among analysts -- runs the risk of building up potentially destabilizing market expectations  Volcker said     He recommended we should not lock ourselves into formalized procedures for international negotiations on exchange rates but instead use other  more flexible means like the recent mmeting in Paris between US treasury and central bank representatives and those of major trade allies  Reuter 3

Pos-money-fx,2 MIDDLE EAST CURRENCY MARKET SEES KEY CHANGES     By Stephen Jukes  Reuters     BAHRAIN  March 25 - Middle East currency dealers meet in Abu Dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in their business  which has seen a growing volume of trade shift from the Arab world to London     The 14th congress of the Inter-Arab Cambiste Association also comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulf currency system is more real that at any time this decade     Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said these issues  and the slide of the Lebanese pound  can be expected to be major talking points     About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks -- including some in London and other major non-Arab financial centres -- are expected to attend the conference which begins on on Saturday     Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that a growing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market  by far the largest in the region  is being carried out in London     The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabias 11 banks  foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks in Bahrain But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based banks are boosting their treasury operations in London     As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade finance in the region declined  many offshore banks in Bahrain ran down their currency operations None of the four major UK Clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island     The two major Bahrain-based international banks  ltArab Banking Corp and ltGulf International Bank BSC have increased their presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading representative offices to branch status to allow dealing     One economist said It is cheaper to run a riyal book in London than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain There is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London     Jeddah-based ltRiyad Bank set up as a licensed deposit taker in London in 1984  while its main rival in Saudi Arabia  ltNational Commercial Bank NCB won a licence in November 1986     The major market maker has traditionally been London-based consortium bank ltSaudi International Bank but the kingdom joint-venture ltSaudi American Bank SAMBA also upgraded its London operation to deposit taker status in mid-February     One senior currency trader in Riyadh said Inevitably the volume of business in London has gained pace with the two new licences for NCB and SAMBA  but there is no question that most of the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia     Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi riyal market is difficult to quantify     Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency deposits held by offshore banks  most in Saudi riyals  dropped to the equivalent of 122 billion dlrs at end-September 1986 from 134 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 150 billion     The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits Riyal trading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very quiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now staff offices on Friday  the Gulf weekend Traders also expect ltArab National Bank to step up London operations     Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market moving completely out of the region  partly because of local demand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agencys SAMA desire to moderate internationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue speculation     There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market shifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain and London is still limited     But for the first time since the formation of the six nation Gulf Cooperation Council GCC in 1981 there are signs that a much mooted currency union could come into force soon     Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final currency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia  Kuwait  Bahrain  Oman  Qatar and the United Arab Emirates     But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary System style with a common peg have been discussed at high level and could be a topic on the GCCs annual summit expected to be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year     One dealer said A lot of exposure is being given to discussions and plans appear to be quite advanced But in the end a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead     One open question is that of a common peg for currencies     The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated since the start of the GCC The Kuwaiti dinar is currently linked to a basket of currencies while the other five currencies are either officially or in practice linked to the US Dollar     Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation against the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies  but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of 7-14 pct  large enough to avoid sudden strains     Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued slide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the undermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks  REUTER 3

Pos-acq,2 BP TO OFFER 74 BILLION DLRS FOR STANDARD SHARES     LONDON  March 26 - British Petroleum Co Plc ltBPL said it intended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co ltSRDN it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash  for a total of 74 billion if the offer is fully accepted     The offer would be made through its ltBP North America Inc unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1 The offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares being tendered     BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based on its own valuation as well as those of its financial advisers It took into account reviews of both public and non-public information     Standard closed in New York last night at 64-78 dlrs  down 1-34 dlrs     BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at last nights close     About a third of the cash payable would be met from BPs own resources     The remainder would come from new borrowings  partly from banks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility and partly from a a new US Dlr commercial paper programme The company said it was in the course of arranging these facilities     BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the groups investment in Standard was its largest single asset Full ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be made without the limitations of a minority interest     BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimum use of its financial resources It was confident oil prices were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the investment     Walters added that it also felt that  due to management changes in 1986  Standard could now operate successfully even in a lower oil price environment     Standards net assets at end-1986 were 702 billion dlrs and in the year it reported a loss of 108 billion dlrs before tax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs     Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise One noted that it was not immediately clear why the group should spend so much money buying a company it already controlled     BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago     It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on the UK Governments recent announcement that it intended to dispose of its remaining 317 pct stake in BP sometime in the 198788 financial year  analysts said     Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted that any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would depend on the reaction of the markets     The deal would probably push BPs gearing up to around 59 pct from 20 pct currently  he said     However  with the likelihood that oil prices would not repeat last years rapid drop the prospects for Standard returning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from its cash flow -- were good     Standard was a high cost oil producer  the analysts noted     Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to make money  and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from production and its downstream activities would push it comfortably into surplus     BP initially took a stake in Standard following the discovery of oil in Alaskas Prudhoe bay in 1969 BP had inadequate distribution facilities in the US While Standard  which was strong on marketing and refining  was short on crude oil     The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management reorganisation of Standard in the past year     The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the tender offer  Spedding said     BPs willingness to take hard decisions such as major balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well received in the markets     The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division -- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by other sectors  REUTER 3

Pos-money-fx,2 JAPAN ISOLATED  YEN RISES  WORLD FEELS CHEATED     By Eric Hall  Reuters     TOKYO  March 30 - Japan is becoming dangerously isolated again as the US And Europe feel they have been cheated by Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth  officials and businessmen from around the world said     As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen  making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments grit their teeth harder  Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise     The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by both sides over the key Maekawa report of April  last year     The document was prepared by a private committee formed by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of Japan head Haruo Maekawa It recommended that to stop friction due to its large trade surpluses  Japan must make a historical transformation in its traditional policies on economic management and the nations lifestyle There can be no further development for Japan without this transformation     Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change But the Japanese remain doubtful about the short  or even medium term prospects of totally transforming their economic habits     The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese prevarication burst last week The US Said it intended to raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to the US On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral semiconductor pact     British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic telecommunications joint venture     On Friday  European currency dealers said European central banks  annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises  might leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen     Eishiro Saito  head of top Japanese business group Keidanren  spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory views last November when he visited the European Community Related to this matter of trade imbalance  the point that I found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the results of the Maekawa report  he said     We explained that the process of restructuring the economy away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between domestic and external demandWould take time  Saito said     Saitos words were ignored In February  EC Industrial Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said I only know that your government  under the leadership of Maekawa  points to restructuring your economy into a less outward looking  more inward looking one It is the Maekawa report which has attracted the most attention in Europe     And Europeans and Americans want quick action A far better answer than protectionism would be structural change within the Japanese economy  the kind suggested by the Maekawa report And we hope to see changes occur in the near future  visiting Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March     Such expectations are now ingrained  which was partly the fault of Nakasone  who heralded Maekawas report as a sea of change in Japanese affairs  said US Officials     Months before the report was issued  US And EC business leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade problem     We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action  said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock     The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their labour  said Philip Caldwell  Senior Managing Director of Shearson Lehman Brothers     Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance     Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as fast as they can  said a European ambassador who has travelled the country asking about this issue     He said People mentioned many things in line with the spirit of the report  including restructuring of the coal and steel industries     A major misunderstanding is that the private report was government policy Europeans are confused about this  underlined by von Moltkes reference to the leadership of the Maekawa report Even so  Japanese officials point to last Septembers government programme of new economic measures Without endorsing the report as policy  officials point out that the government has put its signature to a programme designed to implement the report  the ambassador said  REUTER 3

Pos-money-fx,2 US FED EXPLORES COMMODITY BASKET INDEX     By Alver Carlson  Reuters     WASHINGTON  MARCH 31 - The complex task of wielding control over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices  the newest member of the Federal Reserve Board says     Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the making of monetary policy But they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert Heller  who joined the board last August     He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed  but argues that such an arrangement  particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries  could reduce the volatility of exchange rates     Moreover  it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves  slowing changes in inflation     His idea  which many conservative economists find appealing  has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by President Reagan     It would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation  key indicators such as unemployment  and the rise or fall of the money supply Changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly     Discussed on and off for a long time  the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base     What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes  says Heller     In the past  this anchor was gold but the United States went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies     A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa     The so-called fixed rate system  scuttled in the early 1970s  is still considered unworkable in the present world     But the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely  adding vast pressures to the monetary system  is also being widely questioned     Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also     For one thing  there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy     Moreover  some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement     The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that  not surprisingly  helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems     Treasury Secretary James Baker  the Reagan administrations chief economic architect  has preferred to use the so-called Group of Five industrial countries or sometimes  Seven  as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters    He appears convinced that officials from West Germany  France  Britain  Japan  Italy and Canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing    The Heller approach  while extremely complex  could have a profound impact on the system  ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates     As envisioned by Heller  a basket of say  30 major commodities ranging from wheat to oil  would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis     In times of rising commodity prices  monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices  montary policy might be eased  he says     He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets  and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis     Moreover  most commodity prices are produced  consumed and traded on a world-wide basis  so that an index has a relevance for the entire world  he says     In addition  commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes     Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures  the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions  he says     However  he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by the OPEC cartel  would have to be discounted in such a system     He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities  Reuter 3

Pos-veg-oil,2 EC COMMISSION DEFENDS OILS AND FATS TAX     ANTWERP  June 18 - A spokesman for the European Community Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy on oils and fats  saying that consumers would have to help alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax     Norbert Tanghe  head of division of the Commissions Directorate General for Agriculture  told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days the Commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in the oils and fats sector  Would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem within that sector by paying a levy     The proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable  Tanghe said     Recent estimates put these costs at 40 billion European Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 20 billion Ecus  he said In 1990 the Communitys standstill agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then feel the full impact of its enlargement     The Commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum guaranteed quantity system  he added     Under the Commissions system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector  a reference price of 700 Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced  Tanghe said     Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level     He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural Policys oils and fats regime     The Commission believes that hostile reactions to the proposed tax have for the most part been based on incomplete or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal  he said     Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  GATT  rules     It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products  and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats     EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements  he said     The competitiveness between different oils  whether EC produced or imported  would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax  Tanghe said     The proposed system would not alter the EC nations requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise Community production levels without affecting demand  he said     It is one of the proposals objectives to maintain current import levels  he said     Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the ECs cakes and meals requirements  which are not covered by the stabilising system Furthermore  more than half the oil produced from imported beans is re-exported to third countries  Tanghe added  Reuter 3

Pos-money-fx,2 ECONOMIST URGES MORE TAXES TO LOWER NZ DOLLAR     WELLINGTON  Oct 19 - An income tax surcharge and capital gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of the NZ Dollar  independent economist Len Bayliss said     Bayliss  a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the Bank of New Zealand  said a major depreciation is needed to restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by current government policies     The taxes would help cut the budget deficit  which in turn would lower the value of the NZ Dollar  he said in a speech He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could be much higher than the governments 13 billion dlr forecast     Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product  a major tax increase was probably unavoidable  Bayliss said     He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct value-added goods and services tax  introduced in October 1986  but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary impact of a currency depreciation     The government had failed to bring inflation down despite lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency  he added     New Zealands inflation rate was 169 pct in the year to end-September against 189 pct in the year to end June     The major deficiency in the governments anti-inflation policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit  Bayliss said The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit     The widespread belief that New Zealands problems are going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought is soundly based -- primarily because the governments macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful  Bayliss said  REUTER 3
